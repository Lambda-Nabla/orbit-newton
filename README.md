# Orbit-newton

## About

Orbit-newton is a 2D physics-based space navigation game developed in 24 hours for the 2024 KHE hackathon. The game objective is to navigate your spaceship through the stars to safely land on different planets, complete mini games to collect their data!
But be careful, as every single planet and star in the system will exert its gravity onto your ship. This planetary gravity can either help you maintain a safe orbit, or crash your ship into the planet, dealing serious damage.
Visit 3 different planets and beat their minigames without destroying the ship to win!

## Controls

WASD to move- WS will move forward and backward, while AD will steer the ship.

Minigames will prompt you with their controls when they are activated!
